                        <h2>Adalaj Step-Well</h2>
                        <p>Step wells are quite prominent in Gujarat as they were the only source of water in the arid regions. Thus, the people of Gujarat decided to decorate and ornament these giant structures as well. There are innumerable step wells or vavs in Gujarat and Ahmedabad has one of the finest of all. Named as Adlaj Vav; this step well was built in 1499 by Rudabai, the wife of a local chieftain. The step well is adorned with beautiful platforms and galleries. The shafts of the well are profusely carved with floral and geometric motifs, interspersed with a number of figurines. The carved pillars that support the pavilions are flooded with diffused light and provide ideal resting places. This beautiful Vav is certainly one of the finest places to visit in Ahmedabad.</p>
